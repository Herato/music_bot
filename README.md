# MusicBot2
Rewritten version of MusicBot in Python

To set up the app locally you have to use the command `git clone [link]`. <br />
The link you will find it on the main site of the repo by clicking clone.

After getting a copy of the repo on your device, create a `.env` file and copy variables from `configs`.

To dockerize this app for the first-time use the command <br />
`docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up --build` <br /> 
When using it after it you use the same command just without `--build`
